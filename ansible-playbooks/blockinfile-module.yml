# We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host.
#  Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself.

# Using the playbook, install httpd web server on all app servers. 
#  Additionally, make sure its service should up and running.

# Using blockinfile Ansible module add some content in /var/www/html/index.html file. 
# Below is the content:
<---! Welcome to XfusionCorp!
This is Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!
Please do not modify this file manually! 
--->

# The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

# The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0777 on all app servers.

# Note:  i. Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml 
#             so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
#        ii. Do not use any custom or empty marker for blockinfile module.
