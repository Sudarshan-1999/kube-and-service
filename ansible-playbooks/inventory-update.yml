# a. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host.

# b. Add App Server 1 in this inventory along with required variables that are needed to make it work.

# c. The inventory hostname of the host should be the server name as per the wiki,
#    for example stapp01 for app server 1 in Stratos DC.

# Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml 
#       so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
