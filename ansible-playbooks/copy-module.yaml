# . On jump host create an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory 
# and add all application servers as managed nodes.


# b. On jump host create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml --->
#  to copy /usr/src/finance/index.html file to all application servers at location /opt/finance.


# Note: Validation will try to run the playbook
# using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
# so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
